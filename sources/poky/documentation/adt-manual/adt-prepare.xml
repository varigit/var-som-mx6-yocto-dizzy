<title>Preparing for Application Development</title>

<para>
    In order to develop applications, you need set up your host development system.
    Several ways exist that allow you to install cross-development tools, QEMU, the
    Eclipse Yocto Plug-in, and other tools.
    This chapter describes how to prepare for application development.

    <title>Installing the ADT and Toolchains</title>

    <para>
        The following list describes installation methods that set up varying degrees of tool
        availability on your system.
        Regardless of the installation method you choose,
        you must <filename>source</filename> the cross-toolchain
        environment setup script before you use a toolchain.
        See the "<link linkend='setting-up-the-cross-development-environment'>Setting Up the
        Cross-Development Environment</link>" section for more information.
    </para>

    <note>
        <para>Avoid mixing installation methods when installing toolchains for different architectures.
        For example, avoid using the ADT Installer to install some toolchains and then hand-installing
        cross-development toolchains by running the toolchain installer for different architectures.
        Mixing installation methods can result in situations where the ADT Installer becomes
        unreliable and might not install the toolchain.</para>
        <para>If you must mix installation methods, you might avoid problems by deleting
        <filename>/var/lib/opkg</filename>, thus purging the <filename>opkg</filename> package

            <listitem><para><emphasis>Use the ADT installer script:</emphasis>
                This method is the recommended way to install the ADT because it
                automates much of the process for you.
                For example, you can configure the installation to install the QEMU emulator
                and the user-space NFS, specify which root filesystem profiles to download,
                and define the target sysroot location.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Use an existing toolchain:</emphasis>
                Using this method, you select and download an architecture-specific
                toolchain installer and then run the script to hand-install the toolchain.
                If you use this method, you just get the cross-toolchain and QEMU - you do not
                get any of the other mentioned benefits had you run the ADT Installer script.</para></listitem>

                you can build the cross-toolchain within the directory.
                However, like the previous method mentioned, you only get the cross-toolchain and QEMU - you
                do not get any of the other benefits without taking separate steps.</para></listitem>

            <para>
                Before running the ADT Installer script, you need to unpack the tarball.
                You can unpack the tarball in any directory you wish.
                For example, this command copies the ADT Installer tarball from where
                it was built into the home directory and then unpacks the tarball into
                a top-level directory named <filename>adt-installer</filename>:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     $ cd ~

     $ tar -xjf adt_installer.tar.bz2
                </literallayout>
                Unpacking it creates the directory <filename>adt-installer</filename>,
                which contains the ADT Installer script (<filename>adt_installer</filename>)
                and its configuration file (<filename>adt_installer.conf</filename>).
            </para>

            <para>
                Before you run the script, however, you should examine the ADT Installer configuration
                file and be sure you are going to get what you want.
                Your configurations determine which kernel and filesystem image are downloaded.

                    directory into which you want to install the toolchain.
                    The default directory used is

                    If you do not have write permissions for the directory
                    into which you are installing the toolchain, the
                    toolchain installer notifies you and exits.
                    Be sure you have write permissions in the directory and
                    run the installer again.</para>

    <title>Setting Up the Cross-Development Environment</title>

    <para>
        Before you can develop using the cross-toolchain, you need to set up the
        cross-development environment by sourcing the toolchain's environment setup script.
        If you used the ADT Installer or hand-installed cross-toolchain,
        then you can find this script in the directory you chose for installation.
        For this release, the default installation directory is
        <filename>&YOCTO_ADTPATH_DIR;</filename>.
        If you installed the toolchain in the
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>,
        you can find the environment setup
        script for the toolchain in the Build Directory's <filename>tmp</filename> directory.
    </para>

    <para>
        Be sure to run the environment setup script that matches the
        architecture for which you are developing.
        Environment setup scripts begin with the string
        "<filename>environment-setup</filename>" and include as part of their
        name the architecture.
        For example, the toolchain environment setup script for a 64-bit
        IA-based architecture installed in the default installation directory
        would be the following:
        <literallayout class='monospaced'>

        You will need to have a kernel and filesystem image to boot using your
        hardware or the QEMU emulator.
        Furthermore, if you plan on booting your image using NFS or you want to use the root filesystem
        as the target sysroot, you need to extract the root filesystem.

    <section id='getting-the-images'>
        <title>Getting the Images</title>

        <para>
            To get the kernel and filesystem images, you either have to build them or download
            pre-built versions.
            You can find examples for both these situations in the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;#test-run'>A Quick Test Run</ulink>" section of
            the Yocto Project Quick Start.
        </para>

        <para>
            The Yocto Project ships basic kernel and filesystem images for several
            architectures (<filename>x86</filename>, <filename>x86-64</filename>,
            <filename>mips</filename>, <filename>powerpc</filename>, and <filename>arm</filename>)
            that you can use unaltered in the QEMU emulator.
            These kernel images reside in the release
            area - <ulink url='&YOCTO_MACHINES_DL_URL;'></ulink>
            and are ideal for experimentation using Yocto Project.
            For information on the image types you can build using the OpenEmbedded build system,
            see the
            "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-images'>Images</ulink>" chapter in
            the Yocto Project Reference Manual.

        <para>
            If you are planning on developing against your image and you are not
            building or using one of the Yocto Project development images
            (e.g. <filename>core-image-*-dev</filename>), you must be sure to
            include the development packages as part of your image recipe.

            Furthermore, if you plan on remotely deploying and debugging your
            application from within the
            Eclipse IDE, you must have an image that contains the Yocto Target Communication
            Framework (TCF) agent (<filename>tcf-agent</filename>).
            By default, the Yocto Project provides only one type of pre-built
            image that contains the <filename>tcf-agent</filename>.
            And, those images are SDK (e.g.<filename>core-image-sato-sdk</filename>).

                    With this method, you need to modify the

        <para>
            If you install your toolchain by hand or build it using BitBake and
            you need a root filesystem, you need to extract it separately.
            If you use the ADT Installer to install the ADT, the root
            filesystem is automatically extracted and installed.
        </para>

        <para>

        </para>

        <para>
            To extract the root filesystem, first <filename>source</filename>
            the cross-development environment setup script.
            If you built the toolchain in the Build Directory, you will find
            the toolchain environment script in the
            <filename>tmp</filename> directory.
            If you installed the toolchain by hand, the environment setup
            script is located in <filename>/opt/poky/&DISTRO;</filename>.
        </para>

        <para>
            After sourcing the environment script, use the

        <para>
            Following is an example.
            The second command sets up the environment.

            built filesystem that is located in the
            <filename>~/Downloads</filename> directory.
            Furthermore, this command extracts the root filesystem into the

<section id='optionally-building-a-toolchain-installer'>
    <title>Optionally Building a Toolchain Installer</title>

    <para>
        As an alternative to locating and downloading a toolchain installer,
        you can build the toolchain installer one of two ways if you have a
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#build-directory'>Build Directory</ulink>:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>
                Use <filename>bitbake meta-toolchain</filename>.
                This method requires you to still install the target
                sysroot by installing and extracting it separately.
                For information on how to install the sysroot, see the
                "<link linkend='extracting-the-root-filesystem'>Extracting the Root Filesystem</link>"
                section.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>
                Use <filename>bitbake</filename> <replaceable>image</replaceable> <filename>-c populate_sdk</filename>.
                This method has significant advantages over the previous method
                because it results in a toolchain installer that contains the
                sysroot that matches your target root filesystem.
                </para>

                <para>Another powerful feature is that the toolchain is
                completely self-contained.
                The binaries are linked against their own copy of
                <filename>libc</filename>, which results in no dependencies
                on the target system.
                To achieve this, the pointer to the dynamic loader is
                configured at install time since that path cannot be dynamically
                altered.
                This is the reason for a wrapper around the
                <filename>populate_sdk</filename> archive.</para>

                <para>Another feature is that only one set of cross-canadian
                toolchain binaries are produced per architecture.
                This feature takes advantage of the fact that the target
                hardware can be passed to <filename>gcc</filename> as a set of
                compiler options.
                Those options are set up by the environment script and
                contained in variables like CC and LD.
                This reduces the space needed for the tools.
                Understand, however, that a sysroot is still needed for every
                target since those binaries are target-specific.

         Remember, before using any BitBake command, you
         must source the build environment setup script

         <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-SDKMACHINE'><filename>SDKMACHINE</filename></ulink>
         variable is correctly set if you are building a toolchain designed to
         run on an architecture that differs from your current development host
         machine (i.e. the build machine).
    </para>

    <para>
        When the <filename>bitbake</filename> command completes, the toolchain
        installer will be in
        <filename>tmp/deploy/sdk</filename> in the Build Directory.
        <note>
            By default, this toolchain does not build static binaries.
            If you want to use the toolchain to build these types of libraries,
            you need to be sure your image has the appropriate static
            development libraries.
            Use the
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#var-IMAGE_INSTALL'><filename>IMAGE_INSTALL</filename></ulink>
            variable inside your <filename>local.conf</filename> file to
            install the appropriate library packages.
            Following is an example using <filename>eglibc</filename> static
            development libraries:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " eglibc-staticdev"
            </literallayout>
        </note>
